Yeah, so, my old site is looking beyond long in the tooth.. plus I've really been digging [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) lately. That coupled with the fact that I've been using HTML5 and CSS3 and JS and .. well you know, all the hot freshness of the moment a lot more now than I was then, I've decided it's time. Nothing ground-breaking or earth-shattering. At least this way I won't feel utterly embarassed by my primary online presence.

So, yeah this project also makes extensive use of [the solarized color scheme](https://github.com/altercation/solarized), [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome), and [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery). And Oxford Commas. And improper sentence structures. <sub><sup><sub><sup>And meta-snark</sup></sub></sup></sub>
