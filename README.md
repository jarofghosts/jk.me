Yeah, so, my old site is looking beyond long in the tooth.. plus I've really been digging [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) lately. That coupled with the fact that I've been using HTML5 and CSS3 and JS and .. well you know, all the hot freshness of the moment a lot more now than I was then, I've decided it's time. Nothing ground-breaking or earth-shattering.

At least this way I won't feel utterly embarassed by my primary online presence.
